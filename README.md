# Revisiting Implicit Neural Representations in Low-Level Vision
### [Paper]() | [Project Page]() 
Wentian Xu, Jianbo Jiao <br>
This is the implementation of the paper "Revisiting Implicit Neural Representations in Low-Level Vision".  We provide Jupyter Notebooks for each task in the paper. We also provide a denosing example based on .py file.

## Setup
Here is the list of libraries you need to install to execute the code:
*python = 3.6
*pytorch
*numpy
*matplotlib
*scikit-image
*jupyter

All of them can be installed via `conda` (`anaconda`), e.g.
```
conda install jupyter
```

## How to run
1. Change the file path in jupyter Notebooks or in to the image you want
2. Run each cell in jupyter Notebooks or run the code in `train_denoising.py`
